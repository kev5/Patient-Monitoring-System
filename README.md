# Patient-Monitoring-System
RFID and GSM based Patient Monitoring System ðŸ˜·ðŸš‘

## Overview
* Continuously monitor a patient-at-homeâ€™s pulse rate and temperature using the respective sensors, and alert the nearby emergency services using the GSM module, if critical.
* An RFID reader would read the unique ID stored in each RFID card that is given to every patient. This would automatically retrieve the patient's medical records from the database.
* Developed a website using PHP, CSS and MySQL for ease in maintaining and updating a patientâ€™s medical records.

All the details of the project are included in the [Project Report](https://github.com/kev5/Patient-Monitoring-System/blob/master/BE%20PROJECT%20REPORT.pdf).
